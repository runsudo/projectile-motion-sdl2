# Simple Projectile Motion

A small educational project to help me learn the basics of `SDL2` and `C` by simulating projectile motion.

## Overview

This project simulates the motion of a projectile under gravity using basic physics formulas. It was created as a learning exercise to:

- Understand the syntax and features of `C`.
- Learn how to use the `SDL2` library for simple graphics and animations.
- Explore basic physics simulation concepts.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have `SDL2` installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/runsudo/projectile-motion-sdl2.git
